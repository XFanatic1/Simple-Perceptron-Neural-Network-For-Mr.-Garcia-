Unfortunately, I have lost the code to this and I can only provide you with a screen shot. The perceptron/neural-network algorithm
is given a graph with a bunch of points with coordinates. it has to label the points (generated at random) which are above the line 
(equation of the line is given to machine) in blue and below it red. it uses random weights as its initial weights to make decisions. 
it calculates the error margin in its decisions then adjusts the weightsin accordance to how inaccurate or accurate the program was 
(the machine learning aspect). As you can see my program is very accurate at determining what category in which the points belong to.
